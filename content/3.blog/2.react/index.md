## Stability improvements

We're working hard to make `shuriken-ui/react` more stable and reliable. This release includes several improvements to the core components and utilities. We've also fixed some bugs and improved the overall performance of the library. However, we still think it is not ready for production use. We recommend using it in a development environment only. We're counting on your feedback to make it better and to fix any bugs that may arise.
