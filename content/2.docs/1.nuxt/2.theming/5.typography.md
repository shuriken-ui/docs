# Typography

Guidance for using and tuning typography.

## Typography clusters
Shuriken UI provides `BaseHeading`, `BaseParagraph` and `BaseText` components to render titles and body copy. These components share size and weight props and map to an underlying type system to ensure consistent typography throughout your app.


::CodeGroup

```js [ExampleClusters.vue]
<BaseHeading 
  as="h4" 
  size="lg" 
  weight="semibold" 
  class="mb-4"> 
  Iam a text heading 
</BaseHeading>
<BaseParagraph size="md"> 
  Iam a text paragraph here to show you how to 
  use the typography components. Each one has a 
  configurable size, weight and line height.
</BaseParagraph>
```

## Formatting
You can nest typography components to create rich text formatting.

::CodeGroup

```js [ExampleBold.vue]
<BaseParagraph size="sm"> 
  This is a 
  <BaseParagraph as="span" weight="semibold">
    very important
  </BaseParagraph>
  message!
</BaseParagraph>
```

## Type scale
The typographic system is based on a 13 step scale, every step has a corresponding font-size, line-height and letter-spacing value which are all designed to be used in combination.

## Font weight
The following weights are supported. When using the typography components, you can use the `weight` prop to set the font weight.

## Using fonts
Shuriken UI uses a system font stack for portability and legibility, as well as specificly loaded fonts. Here are the default font stacks before Shuriken Ui starts adding custom fonts through its configuration:
