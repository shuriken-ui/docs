::changelog-group

:::changelog-item{heading}
Breaking changes
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
This release contains breaking changes and aims at improving the development experience by making the framework more consistent and easier to use. Prop names have been changed to reflect their role. The `shape` prop has been renamed to `rounded`, making it easier to understand its role. The `flavor` prop has been renamed to `variant` for the sake of consistency.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
A new configuration object has been added to the `app.config.ts` file. This object allows you to set default props values for each component. This is useful when you want to set a default `variant`, `color` or `rounded` value for all your buttons for example.

:::
:::changelog-item{heading spaced}
Breaking changes
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
A lot of changes have been made to ensure of a better consistency across the framework. This includes getting rid of the `small` and `condensed` unconsistent props and replacing them with a `size` prop. The `size` prop accepts `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` as values most of the time. This also relates to orphan colors that have been removed and rearranged inside a `color` prop for each component that accepts different colors.
