# Introduction

Shuriken UI is a customizable component library for Nuxt and React/Next.js made and maintained by [cssninja.io](https://cssninja.io).

## Shuriken UI

`@shuriken-ui/nuxt` is a free and open-source Tailwind CSS UI Kit. It is a collection of components and templates that you can use to build your next Tailwind CSS project.

Components in Shuriken UI Nuxt are built using the `@shuriken-ui/tailwind` package, which declares components (prefixed with `nui-*`) using the tailwind plugin system. This approach allows to use the same components with different frameworks, letting the Tailwind JIT engine to only process actually used styles.

Shuriken UI is a [Nuxt layer](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers) that provides everything you need to build a modern web app or admin application. All basic components are built with Tailwind CSS and powered by Nuxt. Shuriken UI is actively developed and maintained by [cssninja.io](https://cssninja.io).

Unlike other UI libraries or plugins, `@shuriken-ui/nuxt` is not a Nuxt module. It is a Nuxt layer that you extend from your Nuxt application. Layers is a mechanism that allows you to split your application into multiple directories. Learn more about [Nuxt layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers).

## What is Nuxt?

Nuxt is a full-stack framework that combines Vue.js and Nitro to create universal applications.

### Nuxt overview

With a few settings, you can swap from a full SSR application to a static application, or even a combination of both. Create full server applications as a replacement of express or koa for instance, or create a full stack application with a single framework, including fully typed code, optimized payload, and more.

### Supported providers

It also has out-of-the-box support for a high number of pre configured providers, including Edge Worker, among the most popular ones:

## What is a Nuxt Layer?

A Nuxt application can grow very fast. You can be multiple developers working on the same application, or you can have multiple applications that share common features.

### Layer definition

Layers is a mechanism that allows you to split your application into multiple directories, each with their own `nuxt.config.js` file. Each directory can be a full Nuxt application, with its own `pages`, `components`, `plugins`, and more. At the end, all layers are merged together, representing a single application.

### Codebase optimization

In order to keep your application maintainable, you need to organize your code. Nuxt helps you do that with Layers. Nuxt and Shuriken UI code do not interfere with your own code, as they have minimal dependencies. On top of that, all features are optional, meaning they won't be loaded if you don't actually use them.

### Easy to override

Shuriken UI being a Nuxt layer also allows you override any component, by creating a component with the same name in your application. This allows you to customize the library to your needs, without having to rewrite all the code. You can also leverage the individual component configuration object to change the default behavior of a component.

You should be familiar with Nuxt and its concepts before using Shuriken UI. If not, you should be at least familiar with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and Vue.js [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup).
