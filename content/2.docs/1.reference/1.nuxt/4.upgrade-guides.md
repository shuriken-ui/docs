Breaking changes
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
This release contains breaking changes and aims at improving the development experience by making the framework more consistent and easier to use. Prop names have been changed to reflect their role.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `shape` prop and its values have been changed accross all components. The prop `shape` has been renamed to `rounded` for overall consistency. `shape` prop accepted values have been renamed from `straight` | `rounded` | `smooth` | `curved` | `full` to `none` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `full`. In your projects, if you are using a components that had the `shape` prop, make sure to replace the values with the new ones and to rename the prop to `rounded`.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `flavor` prop has been renamed to `variant`. If you have components in your project using the `flavor` prop, simply rename it to `variant`. The values remain the same.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `<ButtonClose />` component now has a `size` prop accepting `xs` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` as values. The default size is `sm`. Make sure to update your code if you are using this component.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `<Snack />` component now has a new `size`: `xs` value. Make sure to update your code if you are using this component.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
A new `nui` configuration object has been added to the `app.config.ts` file. This object allows you to set default props values for each component. This is useful when you want to set a default `variant`, `color` or `rounded` value for all your buttons for example. The previous `defaultShapes`configuration object has been removed. Make sure to update your code if you are using the component configuration in your `app.config.ts` file.
