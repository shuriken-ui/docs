Breaking changes
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
This release contains a single breaking change and a bunch of internal changes that won't impact your projects. Class names have been changed to reflect their role.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Contrasts**: `<BaseCard />` had legacy contrast prop values like `white` and `white-contrast`. Those have been renamed to match the system and naming in other components. CSS classes have also been renamed for consistency:
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`nui-card-white` **to** `nui-card-default`
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`nui-card-white-contrast` **to** `nui-card-default-contrast`
:::

Features
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Colors**: colors have been harmonized through all components and variants. New `dark` and `black` colors have been added to facilitate monochromatic color palettes. The `light` color has been added in components where it was missing and adapted to existing variants. `default-contrast` and `muted-contrast` contrast colors have been added where they were missing. This allows more consistency and the ability to group buttons and inputs for instance, without seeing different background or border styles.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Forms**: input `color-focus` issue has been fixed and the behaviour has been extended to all form elements that can have a colored border on focus (Input, InputNumber, InputFile, Select, Autocomplete, Listbox, Textarea).
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**ButtonGroup**: you can now use the features of the `<ButtonGroup />` component on any html element with the `role="group"` on it.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Text**: the text component now renders a `<span />` instead of a `<p />`.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Tooltip**: styles have been refactored for more consistency, left and right position arrows fixed.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Classes prop** added to more components, to be able to customize inner styles.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
New `color` prop for the following components:
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`<BaseDropdownItem />`
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`<BaseInputFile />`

Breaking changes
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
This release contains breaking changes and aims at improving the development experience by making the framework more consistent and easier to use. Prop names have been changed to reflect their role.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `shape` prop and its values have been changed accross all components. The prop `shape` has been renamed to `rounded` for overall consistency. `shape` prop accepted values have been renamed from `straight` | `rounded` | `smooth` | `curved` | `full` to `none` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `full`. In your projects, if you are using a components that had the `shape` prop, make sure to replace the values with the new ones and to rename the prop to `rounded`.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `flavor` prop has been renamed to `variant`. If you have components in your project using the `flavor` prop, simply rename it to `variant`. The values remain the same.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `<ButtonClose />` component now has a `size` prop accepting `xs` | `sm` | `md` | `lg` as values. The default size is `sm`. Make sure to update your code if you are using this component.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
The `<Snack />` component now has a new `size`: `xs` value. Make sure to update your code if you are using this component.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
A new `nui` configuration object has been added to the `app.config.ts` file. This object allows you to set default props values for each component. This is useful when you want to set a default `variant`, `color` or `rounded` value for all your buttons for example. The previous `defaultShapes`configuration object has been removed. Make sure to update your code if you are using the component configuration in your `app.config.ts` file.
