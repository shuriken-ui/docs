Breaking changes
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
This release contains a single breaking change and a bunch of internal changes that won't impact your projects. Class names have been changed to reflect their role.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Contrasts**: `<Card />` had legacy contrast prop values like `white` and `white-contrast`. Those have been renamed to match the system and naming in other components. CSS classes have also been renamed for consistency:
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`nui-card-white` **to** `nui-card-default`
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`nui-card-white-contrast` **to** `nui-card-default-contrast`
:::

Features
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Colors**: colors have been harmonized through all components and variants. New `dark` and `black` colors have been added to facilitate monochromatic color palettes. The `light` color has been added in components where it was missing and adapted to existing variants. `default-contrast` and `muted-contrast` contrast colors have been added where they were missing. This allows more consistency and the ability to group buttons and inputs for instance, without seeing different background or border styles.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Forms**: input `colorFocus` issue has been fixed and the behaviour has been extended to all form elements that can have a colored border on focus (Input, InputNumber, InputFile, Select, Autocomplete, Listbox, Textarea).
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**ButtonGroup**: you can now use the features of the `<ButtonGroup />` component on any html element with the `role=”group”` on it.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Tooltip**: styles have been refactored for more consistency, left and right position arrows fixed.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
**Classes prop** added to more components, to be able to customize inner styles.
:::
:::changelog-item{level="2"}
New `color` prop for the following components:
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
`<DropdownItem />`
:::
:::changelog-item{level="3"}
