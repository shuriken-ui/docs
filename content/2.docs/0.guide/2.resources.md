## Tailwind intellisense

If you're using VSCode, you can install the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension to get autocompletion for the utility classes.

### Setting up VSCode

You can read more on how to set it up on the [@nuxtjs/tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/tailwind/editor-support) module documentation, but to summarize, you'll need to add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

::code-group

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
  },
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": true
  }
}
```

::

### TypeScript support

Shuriken UI supports Typescript out of the box. It means you can use the `.ts` extension for your `tailwind.config` file and use javascript `imports` instead of `require`.

::code-group

```ts [tailwind.config.ts]
import { withShurikenUI } from '@shuriken-ui/tailwind'
import colors from 'tailwindcss/colors'

/**
 * Shuriken UI tailwind configuration
 */
export default withShurikenUI({})
```
