### About @shuriken-ui/tailwind

Shuriken UI Tailwind is the main part of the Shuriken UI project by [Css Ninja](https://github.com/cssninjaStudio). Its goal is to provide a set of Tailwind CSS ready components, to be framework agnostic and highly customizable.

This package provides a [Tailwind CSS preset](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) which contains all the components definitions and utilities. It also extends the default theme with some colors and fonts.

All the components are separated in their own [Tailwind CSS plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) and can be configured in the `tailwind.config.ts` file. This way, you can easily customize each component to your needs.

### About @shuriken-ui/nuxt

Shuriken UI Nuxt is a part of the Shuriken UI project by [Css Ninja](https://github.com/cssninjaStudio). Its goal is to provide a set of ready to use components to build apps with Nuxt using the Shuriken UI design system. It requires the `@shuriken-ui/tailwind` package to work.

### About @shuriken-ui/react

Shuriken UI React is a part of the Shuriken UI project by [Css Ninja](https://github.com/cssninjaStudio). Its goal is to provide a set of ready to use components to build apps with React / Next.js using the Shuriken UI design system. It requires the `@shuriken-ui/tailwind` package to work.

### How to contribute

If you find a bug or want to add new features, makes sure to check if it has an impact on the Nuxt or the React versions of Shuriken UI. If it does, make sure to submit a PR to all the projects.

Also, note that we use the `release/next` branch to develop new features. If you want to contribute, make sure to create a new branch from `release/next` and to submit your pull request to the `release/next` branch. (see [Git conventions](#git-conventions))

If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/shuriken-ui/tailwind/discussions).


## Setup the project

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage our dependencies. Make sure to install it first.

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

::

### @shuriken-ui/tailwind

Clone the project on your machine and install the required dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install
```

::

Now you can run the storybook app, which acts as a visual test suite for the components. You can use the storybook to test your changes, or include any new component you've added to the package. Run the storybook app using the following command:


::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

::

Everything is ready, you can start coding! Don't forget to run the tests after your changes to make sure everything is working as expected.

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test
```

::

### @shuriken-ui/nuxt

Clone the project on your machine and install the required dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install
```

::

Now you can start the playground which is a basic Nuxt app using Shuriken UI Nuxt. You can use the playground to test your changes, or include any new component you've added to the package.


::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

::


Everything is ready, you can start coding! Don't forget to run the tests after your changes to make sure everything is working as expected.

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test
```

::

### @shuriken-ui/react

Clone the project on your machine and install the required dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm install
```

::

Now you can start the playground which is a basic Next.js app using Shuriken UI React. You can use the playground to test your changes, or include any new component you've added to the package.


::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

::


Everything is ready, you can start coding! Don't forget to run the tests after your changes to make sure everything is working as expected.

::code-group

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm test
```

## Submitting your changes

Once you are done with your changes, you can submit a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Make sure the tests pass locally by running `pnpm test`, this will run the linter.
- Make sure to create a draft PR if it's not ready to be merged, see [how to change stage of a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)
- Make sure to add a description of your changes, if relevant, add screenshots or gifs to illustrate your changes.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Shuriken UI maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

## Git conventions

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to make our commits more readable and to generate our changelog.

Make sure to prefix your commit with one of the following types:
`fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`

Use the imperative, present tense: “change” _not “changed” nor “changes”_.
