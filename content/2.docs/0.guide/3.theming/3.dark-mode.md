# Dark mode

Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.

## Overview

Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or styling.

## How it works
By default, the main theme is set to `light`. Shuriken UI relies on the [Nuxt color mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/) module to handle dark mode, meaning you don't have to worry about this at all. 

### Using built in components

You can simply use the built in `ThemeSwitch` and `ThemeToggle` components to be able to switch between `light` and `dark` mode:

::code-group

```vue [ExampleThemeComponents.vue]
<template>
  <BaseThemeToggle />
  <BaseThemeSwitch />
</template>
```

### Using your own strategy

In Shuriken UI, the `ThemeSwitch` and `ThemeToggle` components are built on top of the `useColorMode()` composable. This means that you can use the `useColorMode()` composable to build your own custom components, or build a completely custom strategy. 

The only thing that needs to remain consistent is the class that is added to the `html` element, which is `dark` when in dark mode, and `light` when in light mode.

::code-group

```html [index.html]
<html class="light">
  <body>
    <!-- Your app -->
  </body>
</html>
```
