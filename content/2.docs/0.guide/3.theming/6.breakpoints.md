# Breakpoints

Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adaptive layouts.

## Available sizes

Each breakpoint matches a fixed screen width. Values are min-width based and apply when the screen width is equal or greater.

## Customization

You can customize the breakpoints by adding a `screens` section to the `extend` section of your `tailwind.config.ts` file, inside the `withShurikenUI()` configuration object. Only include the breakpoints you want to override in your configuration:

::code-group

```ts [tailwind.config.ts]
import { withShurikenUI } from '@shuriken-ui/tailwind'

export default withShurikenUI({
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        xs: { max: '639px' },
        ptablet: {
          raw: '(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) and (orientation: portrait)',
        },
        ltablet: {
          raw: '(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) and (orientation: landscape)',
        },
        lg: '1025px',
      },
    },
  },
})
```
